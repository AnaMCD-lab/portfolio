### Joe asks:

# Do I have to stop and start the server every time I want to add a new file?

No, you don't. Hugo is usually pretty good at noticing new files. That said, in this book I'm going to prompt you to do so at various times because this ensures you'll see exactly what you should. It also avoids you having to juggle multiple terminal windows or manage background processes.
